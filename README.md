# math-image-to-latex

A simple application designed to allow users to upload photos of mathematical problems, which are then converted into LaTeX code. The app focuses on providing an intuitive interface where users can easily upload images from their devices. Once an image is uploaded, the backend processes the image, extracting the mathematical equations or expressions within it, and converts them into LaTeX format. The converted LaTeX code is then displayed to the user, allowing for easy copy and paste for further use. The app's design is clean and minimalistic, emphasizing usability and straightforward interaction. The color scheme is kept neutral to minimize distractions, with a focus on the functionality of converting images to LaTeX code.
